Sprocket is a platform primarily used to manage and automate organized Esports leagues, one such example being [Minor League Esports](https://mlesports.gg).

The platform uses a Microservice pattern, this service is responsible for parsing replays, currently it supports Rocket League replay files, thanks to the talented guys and gals that work on the [carball](https://github.com/SaltieRL/carball) library.
