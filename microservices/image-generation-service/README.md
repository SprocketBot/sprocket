Sprocket is a platform primarily used to manage and automate organized Esports leagues, one such example being [Minor League Esports](https://mlesports.gg).

The platform uses a Microservice pattern, and this repository contains everything needed to quickly start a new microservice.

To get started, use
```bash
npx degit SprocketBot/service-template .
```

If you have already initialized a repository in the directory you are trying to use, add `--force` to the end of the command.
