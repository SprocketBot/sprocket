/* 
 *   This script escapes queries written for image generation.
 *   It Does all of the following:
 *       Replaces all new line characters with a space
 *       removes all tabs
 *       replaces any sequence of spaces with a single space
 *       removes spaces after '(' and before ')'
 *       escapes any " character to \"
 *    
 *   This will leave a minimal query that can go into the json that will be uploaded to the database
 *   
 *   Usage: simply run node path/to/queryescaper path/to/query_file_name
 *   when using in wsl, you can run the command with a | clip.exe appended to the end to copy the result to your clipboard
